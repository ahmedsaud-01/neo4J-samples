# Neo4j Python Sample Projects

Welcome to my **neo4J-samples** repository!  
This is a collection of small experiments and sample notebooks as I learn to use [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) (a graph database) with Python.

## 📚 About This Repository

I’m not an expert in Neo4j or graph databases—this repo is just a personal learning project.  
I’m using Jupyter Notebooks to try things out, take notes, and play with different features of Neo4j and Python together.

The notebooks include:
- Connecting to a Neo4j database from Python
- Running basic Cypher queries
- Trying out simple data models
- Experimenting with graph visualizations
- Importing/exporting data and other simple tasks

## 🛠️ What You Need

- Python 3.7+  
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [neo4j Python driver](https://pypi.org/project/neo4j/)
- Access to a Neo4j database (can be local or remote)

Install the basic requirements with:

```bash
pip install jupyter neo4j
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone this repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedsaud-01/neo4J-samples.git
   cd neo4J-samples
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open any notebook and follow along.**  
   You’ll probably need to set your own Neo4j connection details (like URI, username, and password) at the top of each notebook.

## 🤔 Why This Exists

I made this repo to help myself learn by doing and to keep track of what I’ve tried.  
If you’re also learning Neo4j and Python, maybe these notebooks will help you, or you might have suggestions!

## 🤝 Contributions

Suggestions and improvements are welcome, but keep in mind this is just a learning playground.
